I learned frontend dev from the internet, and although I do know a fair amount, I want to see how an experienced dev works and know conventional methods Iam missing.
This webpage looks design oriented and far from a normal webpage. But that's exactly what I was planning for, when I did this a couple of months ago. I wanted it to be more interactive.
I can assist building normal webpages too and I hope I get to learn new things.

P.s If u think index.html is any other normal webpage, don't think Iam over estimating myself :)
